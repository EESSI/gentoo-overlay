		ReFrame is a powerful framework for writing system regression tests and benchmarks,
		specifically targeted to HPC systems. The goal of the framework is to abstract away
		the complexity of the interactions with the system, separating the logic of a test
		from the low-level details, which pertain to the system configuration and setup.
		This allows users to write portable tests in a declarative way that describes only the test's functionality.
